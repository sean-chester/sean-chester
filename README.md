# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sean, assistant professor at [UVic, Canada](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/computerscience/index.php)!

I am a big proponent of both [Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science)ðŸ§ª and [Open Education](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/open-education)ðŸ“š and this GitHub profile is my medium for that. Here I share the cutting-edge research that I do with students and other researchers around the world as well as course materials for the classes that I teach.
